Ludum Dare 48-Hour Game Progamming Compo #34

Theme tied between 2-Button-Controls and Growing.

~Possible interpretations:

~~Growing:
 -Nature/Ecosystem
 -RPG-Style (not easy to do 2-button)
 -Combat (RPG-Style, but again not with much variation if 2-button)

~~2-Button:
 -Pong? (lol)
 -At a loss here. Timing/Artistic maybe (Geometry Dash or Impossible Game style maybe?)

~~Combination of both themes:
 -Katamari! (Move around and grow!)

So...I think I will do something like that Katamari game I played a long time ago. You can only move.
Two buttons allows control of turning and pressing both to move forward. Grow by picking up stuff, see
what works, who knows.

-Later note: I looked up the title of the game I had in mind, here it is: Beautiful Katamari.
It's a game I played a good while back ago.

Here it goes!
